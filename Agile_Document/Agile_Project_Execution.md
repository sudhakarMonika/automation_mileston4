# Agile Project Execution Document

## Project Name : **Automation Test Execution Framework**

## Intern : S.Monika

## Internship Duration : 05 Dec 2025 – 28 Jan 2026 (8 Weeks)

## Methodology : Agile – Scrum (Weekly Sprint-Based)

---

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed summary of the Agile execution and deliverables completed during the 8-week internship. The project focuses on developing an automation testing framework for the OrangeHRM web application using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Spring Boot. Each week consisted of a sprint-based plan covering analysis, framework setup, POM implementation, test development, execution, and final submission.

---

## Overview
The main goal of this project was to design and implement a stable, reusable, and scalable automation testing framework. The framework includes browser initialization, base test classes, utilities, Page Object Model implementation, automated test cases, execution reporting, integration with Spring Boot, and performance optimization.
