# Automated Test Execution Framework
## 📌 Project Overview :

The Automated Test Execution Framework is designed to automate the testing of web applications to ensure functional correctness, reliability, and efficiency. The framework was developed over a period of two months using industry-standard automation tools and follows a modular and maintainable design.

The primary focus of this project is automation testing, including UI automation and REST API testing. In the final phase of the project, a lightweight Spring Boot application with a user interface was integrated to demonstrate and trigger automated test execution during evaluation and panel discussions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives :

    Reduce manual testing effort
    Enable reusable and maintainable automation scripts
    Support automated execution of UI and API test cases
    Provide reliable and repeatable test execution
    Demonstrate automation execution flow clearly during evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used :

    Java
    Selenium WebDriver
    TestNG
    Maven
    REST API Testing
    Spring Boot (integration and demo layer)
    Git & GitHub
    IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA

## ▶️ How to Execute Automated Tests :
Prerequisites

    Java installed
    Maven installed
    Browser drivers configured (ChromeDriver or others as applicable)

## Steps to Run Tests :

    Clone the repository

    Open the project in an IDE

    Navigate to the project root

    Run the following command: mvn test

    Tests will execute based on TestNG configuration

## 📊 Reporting :

    Test execution results are generated using TestNG
    Reports provide execution status and logs

## 🧪 Automation Framework Highlights :

    Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
    Reusable base and utility classes
    TestNG suite-based execution
    Maven-based build and execution
    REST API test coverage
    Easy scalability for additional test cases
 
### ℹ️ Note on UI Integration :

The Spring Boot application and UI were integrated during the final phase of the project to demonstrate and trigger automated test execution during evaluation.
The core focus and primary contribution of the project remain on the automated test execution framework.

## ✅ Final Status :

    Automation framework successfully implemented
    UI and API test automation completed
    Agile methodology followed
    Project ready for demonstration and evaluation
